## Data License and Attribution

### Important: Simulated Data Notice

⚠️ **This package contains simulated data for educational purposes only.** The data is artificially generated based on realistic grocery shopping patterns but does not represent real consumer behavior.

### Data Provider Context

**84.51°** - [http://www.8451.com/area51/](http://www.8451.com/area51/)

The original Complete Journey concept and data structure were developed by 84.51°. This Python package uses that structure with simulated data for educational purposes.

### Citation Requirements

When using this educational dataset, please cite:

> 84.51°. (2015). *The Complete Journey: A comprehensive view of household shopping behavior* [Dataset concept]. 84.51°. http://www.8451.com/area51/  
> [Note: This implementation contains simulated data for educational purposes]

### Data Usage Guidelines

**Appropriate Uses:**
- ✅ Educational coursework and tutorials
- ✅ Learning data analysis techniques
- ✅ Data science skill development
- ✅ Prototyping analytics workflows
- ✅ Teaching retail analytics concepts

**Not Appropriate For:**
- ❌ Academic research requiring real consumer data
- ❌ Commercial business decisions
- ❌ Market research or consumer insights
- ❌ Publication in research journals
- ❌ Any application requiring authentic shopping behavior data

**Educational Use Only**: This simulated dataset is designed specifically for learning and should not be used where real consumer data is required.

## Disclaimer

### Data Accuracy

While efforts have been made to preserve data integrity during format conversion:

- The data is provided "as-is" without warranties
- Users should validate results for critical applications
- Any data quality issues should be reported to the package maintainers

### Educational Usage

For educational and learning use:

- Always cite the original data concept source (84.51°)
- Clearly indicate this is simulated data when presenting analyses
- Follow your institution's policies for educational datasets
- Remember this data does not reflect real consumer privacy considerations since it's simulated

### Commercial and Research Considerations

**Important**: This simulated dataset is not suitable for commercial use or academic research:

- **No Real Consumer Data**: All data is artificially generated
- **Educational Purpose Only**: Designed for learning, not decision-making
- **No Commercial Value**: Does not represent actual market conditions
- **Research Limitations**: Cannot support valid research conclusions about consumer behavior

For real data needs, contact 84.51° directly about their actual datasets and licensing terms.
